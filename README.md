# Chive Project Debian Package

## Usage

*   Download the latest .deb (currently chive1.1-0.deb)
*   In a terminal, run `sudo dpkg -i chive1.1-0.deb`
*   In your preferred browser, navigate to `http://localhost/chive`

## Other Notes

*   You need a webserver, and PHP5\. I recommend apache2\. as it is the easiest to install and use.
*   I will do my best to keep up with the releases made by the Chive Project team.
*   Visit the [Chive Project](http://www.chive-project.com)
